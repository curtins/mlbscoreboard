I was trying to combine coding and one of my other passions, one of which is baseball, and was wondering if this seems like a good idea for a side project. My concerns are it will be entirely on the simple side and it's already been done many times before, so I am not sure I will get much out of it, but I am struggling to have any other ideas. Do you guys think this would be a good idea for practice?

I wonder if this is bad and if I should worry about performance impacts having many packages would cause.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> submitted by <a href=\"http://www.reddit.com/user/voidZero-\"> voidZero- </a> <br> <a href=\"http://www.reddit.com/r/Meteor/comments/36zu5u/how_many_packages_is_too_many_packages/\">[link]</a> <a href=\"http://www.reddit.com/r/Meteor/comments/36zu5u/how_many_packages_is_too_many_packages/\">[6 comments]</a>","summary":"I'm working on a prototype of a website concept I created a few weeks ago.

(longwinded)","author":null,"content":"<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\">\n<p>First some background - I'm a geek who has dabbled in programming off and on since my tween years. (I'm now 43.) I'm not a rank noobie, but I'm <strong>no kind</strong> of professional developer either, but I also hope this task shouldn't call for one. I have no experience in web development to speak of, and very little with any language that I'd consider as \"modern\".</p> <p>I run Linux at home, and would prefer using a Linux based system at work to develop. I <em>do</em> like the idea of learning a bit of python while I'm doing this, but I'm not married to the idea, either.</p> <p><strong>So, what the heck am I trying to do, already? OK:</strong></p> <p>I have a small mysql database which contains various details about various network visible hosts that are being checked weekly and monthly against two different sets of criteria. The records are the same format, and sit in the same table, regardless of whether it's the monthly or weekly check being done. </p> <p>We're talking about 8000 records per month being generated, and there is importance both with regard to the monthly data by itself, and with regard to how the details of those records compare to previous months.</p> <p>I just want an interface where I can do 2 things to start - and will use my learning experiences there to get a bit more fancy over time.</p> <p>1) Provide the user with a dropdown list (or similar choice) where they can first pick a \"check type\" (check types for this populated by db query if possible - there is a table that lists all possible check types), then a \"batch date\". In order for this to be useful, the \"batch date\" list would need to be populated from the results database table, based on the choice they make for \"scan type\", so that it actually shows past batch dates which are available.</p> <p>Having selected those two things, a table should be generated in the web browser showing all the results for that batch date and check type.</p> <p>Nice to haves for requirement 1: 1. export to local csv or xls 2. filter and/or sort the table by various fields.</p> <p>2) Provide a simple (dropdown based) interface to perform some simple analysis across past batches of results, and have the resulting table based on those choices instead of a full dump of that batch of data - as a starting point, I'm thinking something like - the top <em>n</em> most commonly occurring values in <em>field_x</em> across the last <em>y</em> batches of data for <em>scantype_z</em>.</p> <p>I <em>think</em> I understand SQL queries well enough from my prior work that those should not be a problem. But making all this come together in browser window, with some level of interaction is where I'm just spinning in circles trying to figure out the right way to accomplish it.</p> <p>Can someone suggest what a good path forward for this would be? I expect to be learning some new things along the way, and that's great. But I don't want to spin my wheels messing around with things that aren't required, or that create unnecessary (learning time) overhead. And, I won't turn my nose up at any point and click method to putting something like this together, but I'm not sure that such a tool exists in any case. </p> <p>I have no particular deadline, but it would be great if I could work on this as a side project and still have something nice to surprise my boss with by the end of the year.</p> <p>Edit: I trimmed this down a bit at the suggestion of <a href=\"http://www.reddit.com/u/nutrecht\">/u/nutrecht</a> - happy to provide more details as needed.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> submitted by <a href=\"http://www.reddit.com/user/nothinbuttherain\"> nothinbuttherain </a> <br> <a href=\"http://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/37bqr5/simple_imo_webbased_front_end_to_a_simple_db_for/\">[link]</a> <a href=\"http://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/37bqr5/simple_imo_webbased_front_end_to_a_simple_db_for/\">[4 comments]</a>","summary":"First some background - I'm a geek who has dabbled in programming off and on since...","url":"http://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/37bqr5/simple_imo_webbased_front_end_to_a_simple_db_for/","published":"2015-05-26T13:32:32.000000Z","created_at":"2015-05-26T14:31:30.342569Z"},{"id":833841690,"feed_id":183300,"title":"Put your programming skills to the test in BaconGameJam 09, coming up on 12th June","author":null,"content":"<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\">\n<p><strong>48 hours from 2015-06-12 to 2015-06-14!</strong> </p> <p>(22:00 UTC Fri 12th - 22:00 UTC Sun 14th June)</p> <p><strong>What is a game jam??</strong></p> <p>A game jam is an organised event where many teams of people try to make a game in a limited time frame.

I think a lot of aspiring programmers might benefit from hearing my story, but I would also <strong><em>really</em></strong> appreciate hearing the opinions of more senior developers on where I should take my career from here. In order to preserve my identity some of the more personal details will be generalized. Thanks for reading!</p> <h1>My college job</h1> <p>I started my internship/job at a fortune 500 company nearby the college I attended. The job description made it sound like it would be exclusively a development position for computer science majors (like me!), but it turned out to be 80% data entry and 20% development. I was a little disappointed at first in learning that, but it was hard to be upset. The hours were great. The 4 other people on my team were fantastic to work with; our lead developer that I worked under was extremely knowledgable, helpful, and pleasant to be around. The hours were essentially make-up-your-own time schedule. The building I worked in was gorgeous, and my desk overlooked a pond that was always full of ducks and swans. But perhaps most important of all, the software development I did do was extremely gratifying. Learning and solving problems was something I wanted to do and I looked forward to my career as a developer.</p> <h1>Real Job hunting</h1> <p>Two weeks after I graduated I applied for a couple entry level software development jobs in my area. At this time I was still working my college job (~5 hour days), and my daily schedule was great with plenty of time to frequent the gym, learn more programming, and spend time with my friends/family. The day after sending out my applications I got a call from one of the places to which I applied. They said they hired contractors and sent them to jobs, and those places would hire them full time after their contract ended in 3 months if they liked them. They wanted to send me to a bank that needed junior developers. I really wasn’t familiar with this contractor model at the time and didn’t know anything about this bank they were sending me to, but I figured I go at least for the interview experience. It was for a .NET position, which I was fairly experienced in (for someone of my experience level), but I spent about 5 hours total researching and studying interview questions.</p> <h1>My first real job interview</h1> <p>I get to the bank. It’s downtown, but I actually really like being in the city. It’s a pretty short drive from my house. I didn’t know where to park and ended up paying $15 in a lot nearby because I didn’t want to be late (I was told where the best place to park was but I couldn’t find it in a reasonable amount of time). I go up to the instructed floor and wait. I’m called in and shake hands with the interviewer; he explains he’s about to give a technical interview that might take around an hour. He asks me question after question of pretty easy questions, things like “what’s a regex?” “what's linq?” “whats an implicitly-typed variable?” - I think I only didn’t know the answer to one question after the whole hour was up. After we finish the technical interview, he asks me a couple “logic” questions like “how many pennies would it take the reach the ceiling if stacked on top of one another from the floor up?”, and things like that. We talk a little more about the position, and then I leave. As I’m getting back into my car my recruiter from the contracting firm calls me. “Hey, you got the job!” So this was really super unexpected - I didn’t even put the application in more than a week ago and I already have an offer! She asks how much I was expecting to make, and I told her that I’m open to offers. To be honest, I didn’t know what to say. I did some research previously and found that the average wage in my area for for an entry level dev was around 53k/year. She told me to give her a ballpark, and I told her 60k. She responded to me like I had five heads: “Well thats REALLY out of the reasonable range for this position. Usually we hire at 46k, but since you did so well on the interview I might be able to get that up a little more. I’ll check with our president and call you back.” She calls back a couple minutes later and says that they can do 50k. I told her I’d need a day to think about it, and she says that that’s fine. I talk it over with my family and friends and decide that I’ll accept the offer, but will still keep an ear out for something that pays better. I was a bit nervous that something better might not come for a while yet since I haven’t heard from any of the other places I’ve applied, so I figure what the heck.</p> <h1>My first real job</h1> <p>I report my first day to the place I met for my interview. I meet my boss and she shows me to the development floor. I realize around this time that it was pretty stupid of me to accept a job before seeing the actual workplace - my interview was only on a floor for executives/conferences. But the area was pretty nice. It was desks all in parallel lines. Each person got one 30” monitor in the middle of their workspace and two 24” monitors on either side. It had windows at the end of each row of desks that offered a fantastic view of the city. Pretty nice, I thought. The floor itself had probably 300 developers on it which was way more than I was expecting. I meet my team, and they’re great. Really nice people, and they’re all my own age. We’d become pretty good friends over my time there, and would do things like go to lunch at a nearby restaurant, and bars after work. And what’s more, one of my best friends from college got a job at my employer and was joining my team! Things we’re looking pretty great. Of my team, this was the first real, career job that all of them have had. In fact, I would find that except for a special few, all of the other ~300 developers on the floor were entry level. </p> <p>The problem was of the actual work. My job was to develop a web application. With a bunch of entry level devs working on it, the code was pretty sketchy at best. It was a code monkey job; I’d pretty much change constants/update tables based on new rates or whatever. I had no design input whatsoever, and disagreed (usually openly) about the design decisions my boss made. Fast forward 4 months. I’ve made it past my probationary, contracted period and have been hired full time, but I’m already looking harder for a new place that takes coding more seriously/offers better career advancement.</p> <h1>My second real job interview</h1> <p>I’d really like to work at the place I had my college job, but unfortunately they don’t hire entry level developers full time. There was a place nearby that was an actual software company with a good reputation as an employer. They make software for a niche market, but hold a sizable market share. I make some time to go to an open interview after work. There’s like 150 recent college grads there, and I’m showing up as it’s coming to a close since I had to work. I meet with a couple managers, we talk, I pass out resumes and head home. A month goes by with no response, so I email the recruiter to ask him for an interview, and he accepts. </p> <p>On interview day I took the day of work and come in to this new software company. The recruiter shows me around, and it blows me away. Theres video games set up, pool tables, cornhole games set up, cafeteria with free food, people getting chair massages, the whole shebang.The best part to me, however is that they do flex hours! I’m not a morning person, so I envisioned working 11-7 every day. I’m pretty much floored by all these great things that I pay little attention to the actual workspaces, which were high-walled cubicles with dual 24” screens. He takes me to a conference room where I await the manager that gives the technical interviews. He comes, sits down, and starts asking questions. Something's different here - I don’t know as many of the answers to his questions. In fact I don’t know the answers to MOST of the questions. I haven’t even heard of many of the things he was talking about. I begin to panic a little. After it ended I did what was probably my saving grace, which was ask him where I could find the answers to the questions I didn’t know. We talk a little about development exercises I could do, and I’m genuinely interested in starting to do them. He leaves and says either the recruiter will come back and I can leave or another manager will come in if they’re not busy. I had a feeling that if I didn’t see another manager I wouldn’t get the job. I wait another 20 minutes until I see a new a face - another manager. I’m a little relieved and we talk about my goals and my resume. This goes on for another 3 managers and another 5 hours - thats right, this whole interview process took about 6 hours in total. </p> <h1>My Second real job</h1> <p>A week later I get a call, and get offered the job! Exciting times! They offered me 58k, but I negotiated to 60k, which was a pretty big bump for me. I weighed my options for keeping my current job vs. taking the new one and everything was coming up new job, so after 5-6ish months at my first job, I quit and begin my second. I’m put on a team that does .NET winforms and my boss explains to me that I have a 30 day probationary period where I’ll sink or swim - not unlike my last job. He assigns me a task that he figures will take the whole 3 months. I sit down at my desk and begin. I really don’t understand any of this, but I keep trying, keep asking questions to stack overflow, and occasionally ask questions to my boss/teammates. See at this new job, people don’t really talk to each other unless they have to. People like to work by themselves here without socializing, and when bothered seem almost angry. In fact, most people never leave their cubicle unless they have to. I’d find that the pool, ping pong, video games, etc were pretty much a recruiting tool, and the massages only come in one day a month. People in the workplace are friendly, but people aren’t friends. Besides, everyone is way older than I am; I’m 24 and everyone else is 40s/50s...I don’t have a huge desire to be friends with people that old. Asking questions is also frustrating because, unlike my last job where I could just ask the question to the person sitting next to me, I now had to physically get up, walk to a different cubicle, then ask my question. This is awful in those “one question leads to another” situations. </p> <p>But I truck through my assignment and finish it ahead of schedule. My boss is very impressed, and I make it through my 3 month period with even a small raise. Day after day I go to my desk, look at the changes I need to make to our core product and make them, exchanging emails with QA. Fast forward 7 months, which brings us close to the present day.</p> <p>At this point I’m exhausted in every sense of the word. “Flex hours” to my company means “you can show up between 6am and 9am”, so every day that goes past I’m more tired. My brain is also wondering where the hell “summer break” is that I’ve been having all my life. I’m a pretty social person and I’m getting pretty sick of my social-less office. I’m beginning to miss my old job. I’m REALLY missing my college job. I talk to no one from my old team at this point, not even my good friend from college. I know it’s largely my fault for not keeping up with them, but I can now only hang out on weekends, and I’d usually rather use my weekends to catch up on sleep/housework.</p> <p>It’s about this time that my boss proposes a huge expansion for our company to the president of development and he accepts. Our team is set to make the design decisions. It’s estimated to take a year to design and implement with many, many moving parts. The senior developers on my team are doing the bulk of the work, but I’m assigned a hefty load. I ask a lot of questions but I understand almost 0% of what I’m told. I keep trying my best to learn, but we’re doing some really advanced stuff that I haven’t seen before. I keep trying to do my tasks and I fail. My boss is pretty noticeably frustrated with me; we’re on a tight timeline, I’m going way over my estimated hours of work, and even then I’m not even doing it correctly. I hate to sound overly-dramatic, but I really feel overwhelmed. I’m getting stress headaches all the time and am losing sleep. </p> <p>So now I’m contemplating another job switch, but I’m afraid that if I keep switching jobs, future employers will look negatively on that. I’d like to settle in a new city actually, having lived in this area my whole life and haven’t traveled much. I’ve even - fairly seriously - contemplated switching careers at this point. I’m thinking that this one might be too high-stress for me, despite my skills and excitement for the work. Maybe I’d be more suited for an IT-like position where I can set up computers or something, I don’t know. Maybe I’m just making a big deal about nothing and should just trudge on.</p> <h1>Final thoughts</h1> <p>So this is what I extend to people looking to be developers: your workplace is probably just as, if not more important that the actual job itself. Don’t be like me - take notice of what the people you will be working with are like and if the setup will be something that can lead to your success. The other thing I can say is that you should make sure that you are choosing the correct career for yourself. Just because you major in CS doesn’t mean you are pigeonholed to certain careers. This is something I wish I would have thought more about before rushing myself into the workforce. If you’ve read this far I want to really, truly thank you for listening and I hope you’ve got something out of it!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> submitted by <a href=\"http://www.reddit.com/user/programmer564698\"> programmer564698 </a> <br> <a href=\"http://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/37b42h/my_first_year_and_a_half_as_a_professional/\">[link]</a> <a href=\"http://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/37b42h/my_first_year_and_a_half_as_a_professional/\">[16 comments]</a>","summary":"Hey everyone, I wanted to write a little about my personal experiences as a recent...","url":"http://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/37b42h/my_first_year_and_a_half_as_a_professional/","published":"2015-05-26T09:16:10.000000Z","created_at":"2015-05-26T14:31:29.956776Z"},{"id":833841123,"feed_id":120144,"title":"[HIRING] An illustrator to give my logo a facelift","author":null,"content":"<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\">\n<p>I'm a digital marketer working under the brand name eMojo for quite a while and I think it's time I give my logo a bit of a face lift - [link](emojo.co.il/logo.png)</p> <p>I'm looking for something that captures the same spirit, but looks a bit more impressive. </p> <p>I'd love to get some price quotes via PM with examples of previous work.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> submitted by <a href=\"http://www.reddit.com/user/Oma_ster\"> Oma_ster </a> <br> <a href=\"http://www.reddit.com/r/forhire/comments/379gh3/hiring_an_illustrator_to_give_my_logo_a_facelift/\">[link]</a> <a href=\"http://www.reddit.com/r/forhire/comments/379gh3/hiring_an_illustrator_to_give_my_logo_a_facelift/\">[2 comments]</a>","summary":"I'm a digital marketer working under the brand name eMojo for quite a while and I...","url":"http://www.reddit.com/r/forhire/comments/379gh3/hiring_an_illustrator_to_give_my_logo_a_facelift/","published":"2015-05-25T23:25:55.000000Z","created_at":"2015-05-26T14:30:51.350721Z"},{"id":833841122,"feed_id":120144,"title":"[Hiring] (Online) Web Developer for Esports Organization","author":null,"content":"<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\">\n<p>Hello!

(kinda like Thinking in Java, where theres like 50 pages of what is a class explanation) Most of the books I ran into just briefly cover the subject then run you straight into examples and code.</p> <p>Also I am starting to lose my motivation and am getting really depressed, havent touched anything programming related for a week.</p> <p>Thank you in advance</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> submitted by <a href=\"http://www.reddit.com/user/gvozdeni88\"> gvozdeni88 </a> <br> <a href=\"http://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/37bucx/advice_for_the_fundamentals_book/\">[link]</a> <a href=\"http://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/37bucx/advice_for_the_fundamentals_book/\">[comment]</a>","summary":"Hello dear developers, I am a self-taught wannabe programmer.

I would prefer another route though, so I can work a full time job while studying..</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> submitted by <a href=\"http://www.reddit.com/user/Alektorophobiae\"> Alektorophobiae </a> <br> <a href=\"http://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/37buj9/online_ms_in_software_engineering_programs/\">[link]</a> <a href=\"http://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/37buj9/online_ms_in_software_engineering_programs/\">[comment]</a>","summary":"Hey everyone, I am graduating in a few days with a Major in English; however,...","url":"http://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/37buj9/online_ms_in_software_engineering_programs/","published":"2015-05-26T14:03:46.000000Z","created_at":"2015-05-26T14:29:47.997861Z"},{"id":833840177,"feed_id":1000378,"title":"What opportunities do dual major students have?","author":null,"content":"<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\">\n<p>I just graduated as a double major in math and cs.

After graduation, I joined a post-doctoral training program (2-year fellowship) in the Northeast. The program is affiliated with a university and they place you at a pharmaceutical company. The program is meant to help pharmacists get experience in the pharmaceutical industry. The program has “graduated” almost 700 pharmacists YTD. The program gives you a small stipend (~45k/yearly). Currently, I am about 11 months into the 24 month commitment I made. </p> <p>The team I work with is 4 individuals, the hiring manager, and three other associates. For the first 6 months, I worked with the hiring manager and she’s great. She is extremely well-connected throughout the company and a pleasure to work with. However, over the past 5 months, I haven’t been able to work with her at all. Her projects have taken a different direction and she placed another lady in charge of me. My new immediate boss is impossible to work with. She has a super type A personality and I can’t stand it at all. She is super critical of everything I do, and lacks empathy. Every day I get so frustrated to a point where I hate coming into work. She judges me on every action that I make. She tries to micromanage every decision I make and I literally can’t stand it anymore. My hiring manager is aware, and has proposed I do a rotation in a different department. I may be open to this; however, about 2 weeks ago, a previous employer of mine (not a pharmaceutical company) reached out to me and told me about an open position. They wanted me to interview, and at the moment it’s pending whether I got the job or not. It’s for a position I know I will enjoy, and I’ve spoken to many people on the team and it seems like I would be a great fit for the position. I don’t want to leave the company/program, but over the past 11 months, I realized this is not what I want to be doing in my career. </p> <p>Now, the problem is, if I leave the fellowship early, it looks very bad on me, and I burn many bridges within the current pharmaceutical company and potentially many others. To get back into the industry in the future may be very difficult.</p> <p>Honestly – What I want to do is, say F*** it. I’ll leave, and figure out the next steps later. This new job is exactly what I want to do for the next 2-3 years and opens up my future path significantly. I know it’s very bad to burn bridges, but I think I’ll be able to recover. </p> <p>What would you do in my situation?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> submitted by <a href=\"http://www.reddit.com/user/yankees3k2\"> yankees3k2 </a> <br> <a href=\"http://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/37bxgx/help_quitting_a_fellowship_program_for_a_new_job/\">[link]</a> <a href=\"http://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/37bxgx/help_quitting_a_fellowship_program_for_a_new_job/\">[comment]</a>","summary":"I graduated from Pharmacy school in May of 2014.
