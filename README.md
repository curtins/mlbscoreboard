This application links to the mlb.com website to obtain live real time data. The Two types of data are pulled from the site and rolled into this
web application The first is a series of JSON files which describe all the current games and status. The second source is a collection of RSS feeds
which are consolidated by MLB Division and rolled out in the various tickers. I have also added a few Feeds for the Boston Red Sox.

During the season, a list of all games with actual real time scores and game information is available in this application. I have some 
additional ideas I will be adding before next season.
